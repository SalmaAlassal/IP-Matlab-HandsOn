# Image Processing - Matlab Hands-on

This repository contains my solutions to the labs of the Image Processing course. The labs are written in Matlab.

These labs were completed just before my practical exam. If you find any mistakes, please send a pull request. Also, if you are here just before your exam, I send you my best wishes. Good luck!
